Hi, I'm Jonathan Bertscher. I'm a Data Analyst at Booking.com. This is a place for me to explore topics that are of interest to me. I believe that one of the best ways to learn is to teach and do. By explaining things to others, and creating, I hope to deepen my own knowledge and understanding, and sharpen my toolbox.
