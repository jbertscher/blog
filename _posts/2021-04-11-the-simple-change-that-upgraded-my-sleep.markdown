Sleep issues are a scourge of modern times. I often hear about sleep problems from friends, family, and colleagues. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised, considering evolution has not adapted us for the overstimulated lives that have become standard. Being constantly switched on during the day makes it difficult to switch off when we want to go to sleep. This doesn’t only have emotional and physical ramifications for individuals. [Rand](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/the-value-of-the-sleep-economy.html) found that sleep deprivation could be costing countries up to 3% of GDP due to loss in productivity and health-related risks[^rand].

I endeavoured for a long time to get this part of my life under control. But despite the meditating, the journaling, limiting my device-time, and attempting to wind down at night, when I laid my head on my pillow, my mind would race. I’d finally fall asleep after 90 minutes and then, diabolically, not be able to wake up in the morning!

Recently my sleep quality has improved dramatically. I feel ready for bed at night and frequently wake up before my alarm in the morning. I attribute this to one embarrassingly simple behaviour. Credit for this goes to Professor Andrew Huberman[^huberman], a neuroscientist at Stanford, whose [Huberman Lab podcast](https://hubermanlab.libsyn.com/) is a gem. When I learned about the mechanism behind why doing what I’m going to describe works, I felt enlightened. It’s one of those elegant concepts that you nevertheless overlook, perhaps because it’s so obvious.

What this comes down to is getting your body’s natural rhythms in sync with when you actually want to go to sleep and wake up. You may have heard of the circadian rhythm, the 24 hour cycle which governs our wakefulness and sleep, like a clock that tells your body when it’s time to wake up and when it’s time to sleep. The problem is that for many of us, it’s not set properly.

If everyone around the world naturally felt like waking up or going to sleep at the same objective moment then some people would be waking up in the middle of the night and going to bed at 4pm. Your body doesn’t just know that 11pm in your time zone is time for bed. Our bodies use cues from our environment to figure out where we should be in the circadian cycle in our local time. And the most important of these signals is light.

Getting light on your retina within an hour after waking up kick-starts your circadian rhythm by producing cortisol among other hormones, which makes you feel awake, and then about 12-16 hours later, ramping up the production of melatonin, which makes you sleepy. 

And that’s not all! You can supercharge this effect by also viewing sunlight around sunset. The low solar angle of the light rays provide your body another anchor by which to set your circadian clock. But this has another added benefit. Your body becomes more sensitive to light as the day goes on. And light retards the production of melatonin. The upshot of this is that artificial light, whether from lightbulbs, TV, or our devices, can make it difficult to sleep even if our circadian rhythm is ticking along smoothly. Viewing light at sunset can help to dampen this effect, meaning that artificial light at night will be less pernicious in preventing us from sleeping.

The trick is to get enough light in your eyes at the right times.  And consistency here is also key. It’s pretty confusing for your body if it has to keep changing the cycle all the time.

Now, you might be saying, “Great! I sit next to the window while I work in the morning so I’m getting my dose of photons.” Unfortunately window glass diminishes the intensity of the light so it would take many times longer to get enough light to kickstart the process. And since you only have a limited time window with which to do this, you’re better off going outside.

So, what I’ve started doing, which has had an outsized benefit on my sleep, and by extension my life, is to get outside for 3-10 minutes in the morning and then again around sunset. The first morning was rough. I had to fight the urge to hit snooze. But I’m very glad I did. I fall asleep easier, am less fatigued during the day, and more often feel like I’ve had a good night’s sleep. I still sometimes struggle to fall asleep, especially when there’s a lot on my mind. I think that’s unavoidable. But It feels like I’ve found a piece of a puzzle that, once placed, causes the entire picture to make sense.

So that’s it - a really simple, easy, and costless way that you could potentially massively improve your quality of sleep. But what works for one person might not work for anyone else so the best you can do is try and experiment for yourself.
