We have the greatest chance at being happy, satisfied with our lives, and motivated to succeed in our endeavours, in my opinion, if we concentrate on the aspects of life that are within our control. Otherwise we are leaving these things to chance, that fickle of friends. This is why I believe that we should reframe our conception of success and failure around how well we executed on a process rather than on any particular outcome. In this post, I explain why I think this and what I believe you can do to take your long-term happiness and motivation into your own hands.

# Success is to a large degree outside of our control

The degree to which we succeed in anything is dictated by many, many things outside of our control. It starts from birth - in the genetic lottery. Then there are the ways that our upbringing and experiences in life shape us, which combine with nature to form our psychology. On top of this, there’s ordinary, everyday luck “in the moment” - you can practice something to boredom and yet still mess up when you need to execute for real. That’s to say nothing of the influence of other people. Even if we prepare to the best of our abilities, we cannot control what others do, think, or feel. Someone who doesn’t get a job offer just because another candidate was preferred is to some extent unlucky that the other candidate applied for the same job.

And yet we pin so much happiness on the outcome of an event. This can lead to excessive anxiety before the outcome and anger after it. It can lead us to feeling overwhelmed by all the things outside of our control and to lower motivation when things don’t work out the way we’d like.

# Focus on what is in our control

In [A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5617966-a-guide-to-the-good-life), William Irvine suggests that we are better off setting internal rather than external goals - internal here referring to things over which we have control and external to those that we don’t. Using the example of tennis, he suggests that your goal could be to play to the best of your abilities rather than winning the match.

There are two things I like about this. First, it doesn’t fight with reality. The reality is that there are many factors that go into winning a tennis match, many of which are outside of my direct control, and therefore the outcome of any particular match is not entirely within my control. If I pin my happiness on winning a match, I am by definition giving up control of my happiness to fate or how others perform. I can tip the scale of happiness in my favour by finding it in the things that are within my control.

The other thing I like about this is that it helps me sustain my motivation in the short and long term because I’m not fixated on the outcome of a particular match, or how I’m playing while I’m in it, but rather on how well I move the controllable levers that go into winning. Losing can be demotivating. If I lose but played to the best of my abilities, I achieved my goal, which can help to avoid that demotivation. Furthermore, by reflecting on what I can do to perform even better in the achievement of my internal goal - how I could play even better next time (maybe by improving my pre-game nutritional intake) - I am focused on improving and optimistic that I can, which helps to motivate me further.

# From external goals to internal goals

The general principle here is to make your goal something that’s in your control but highly correlated to the outcome that you desire. While these things are perfectly good heuristics, they aren’t directly actionable, since these things are in turn influenced by other factors, some of which are outside of your control. I believe that we can go a step further and orient our goals around the process itself.

# From internal goals to the process being the goal
 
What is inside of our control? To quote Epictetus, “Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our actions.” 

Progress in mastering those things within our control can be encapsulated by the process. James Clear [argues](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems) for “falling in love with the process rather than the product”, focusing on systems rather than setting goals based on outcome. But the process - and the systems we put in place to achieve a particular outcome - are exactly those things that are within our control - what we strive for (what we want), our mental game (what we think), and the actions we take (what we do). Bringing Irvine and Clear’s ideas together, the goal should be cultivating the best process we can. This translates into putting in place great systems and following through with them over an extended period of time.

# Focusing on process over outcomes for individuals and teams can lead to better outcomes

Let’s say you lead a team and at the end of the quarter you don’t meet your goals in terms of output. You and your team failed to achieve your desired outcome. If you’re solely focused on the outcome, this can feel like a real setback, be demotivating, anxiety-inducing, and even depressing - for you and your team. 

But, what if your goal was to have the best process you could possibly have over time? You find that one of 2 things happened: 
There’s nothing you could be doing better - your process was flawless: in this case, you met your goal. If you could not possibly have done better, you have nothing to be upset about. You should celebrate having done everything within your control admirably.
You realise that there is room to improve on the process. The outcome of an event can be feedback telling you how to bolster your process. Reflecting on how you can improve the process based on these signals is part of a great process. 

In reality, since nothing is perfect, you’re more often than not going to fall in the second bucket. And that’s ok because the goal is to have a fantastic process and the process generally doesn’t end when the outcome of any event becomes known (unless we’re talking about something one-off and really high-stakes but most of life isn’t like this, unless our goals are super narrow).

Either way, over time, by following a solid process, you maximise the chance that you’ll succeed in your outcome because you’re less likely to be demotivated and distracted by the elements outside of your control. Tweaking your process until it’s water-tight, and executing on it consistently over time, you’re doing the best you can do.

This doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t care about the outcome at all. Be realistic in your failure to achieve the outcome that you desired. I’m not talking about giving yourself a participation medal just for showing up. But that’s different from being satisfied with having tried your best and having rigorously followed a solid process that you believe gave you the best chance at success. It may very well be that failure in your outcome underlies a failure in your process as well. It may help to analyse where you failed in your outcome and how the process could be improved so that next time you have an even greater chance of succeeding.

As Clear says, “I've found that goals are good for planning your progress and systems are good for actually making progress.”

# How to move towards process-oriented goals
Ok, so assuming you’re convinced that in a perfect world, we’d peg our happiness on how well we succeed in the process rather than the outcome, how does one go about doing this practically? It’s much easier said than done of course.

I believe that there are 2 steps to this. First, separate the process from the outcome. Then reframe what you’re trying to achieve in terms of process rather than outcome. 

### How to separate process from outcome

Work backwards from the outcome you want to achieve. What are the high-level elements that go into succeeding?
From the list above, recognise what is in your control, what is partly in your control, and what is not at all in your control. For those things partly within your control, what specific actions can you take?
Create a process based on the things that you can do - the levers you can pull that will increase your chances of achieving the outcome you desire over time (your success rate). 

Let’s use the example of applying for a new job:

### How to reframe your happiness to depend on the process rather than the outcome

Recognise that, given the things outside of your control, it doesn’t make sense for your goal to be succeeding in any one event. The best you can do is hope to increase your success rate over time. Following on from our job-seeking example above, that could translate into moving through to the next round for a higher proportion of interviews.
Recognise that increasing your success rate means succeeding in the execution of your process to the best of your ability - in this case improving your experiences, skills, and knowledge over time; being as prepared as you can be before the interview (given current information and time constraints); and being as relaxed and optimistic as possible during the interview. The book [Designing Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26046333-designing-your-life) suggests that your goal should be to get as many job offers as possible instead of getting any particular job. While I think that this moves us in the right direction, I don’t think this should not be the goal itself. While it’s something more tightly connected to what’s in your control, it’s the focus on the process that will actually increase your success rate. 
Commit to your goals being to execute on the process as well as possible. Be explicit about this. When people ask you how you’re feeling about the job interview, answer in terms of those goals. Tell them how prepared you believe you are and about your tactics for being relaxed before the interview - instead of how you feel about your chances of getting to the next round of interviews.
Before, during, and after the interview, really focus on your process-centred goals. Pay as little attention as possible to thoughts about the outcome of the interview itself. The more mind-space you take up with your process-centred goals, the less you will naturally concern yourself with the outcome-centred ones.

# Easier said than done

We are hard-wired to be focused on goals and the outcomes of events. It’s not easy to focus on the process and to pin our happiness on it. I doubt anyone gets it perfect (I certainly don’t!) but moving closer in this direction moves us closer to achieving a lasting satisfaction with our lives and healthier levels of stress.

Somethings that can help:
+ Be grateful for the small improvements you see in the outcome as you progress in the process. It helps to keep track of your incremental progress here to appreciate how far you’ve come. Be aware of how tweaking the process improves your success rate and try to find satisfaction in that.
+ Don’t take things personally. Realise that the outcome of an event doesn't mean anything about you. You may feel bad but you can actually learn to sit with those feelings and they pass pretty quickly if you don’t feed them. Meditation, journaling, self-reflection, and therapy have helped me personally in this regard. 

Ultimately the shortest path to a better life is to accept where we are and appreciate what we have, no matter what happens. As Irvine says, “the easiest way for us to gain happiness is to learn how to want the things we already have.” Obsessing over the process, rather than the outcome of any particular event, gives us a fighting chance.
