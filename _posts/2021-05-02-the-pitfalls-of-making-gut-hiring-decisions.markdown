When deciding whether to hire someone, should you “trust your gut” or attempt a systematic approach? According to the Society for Human Resource Management, [the former is frequently seen as the norm](https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/Pages/Trust-Your-Gut-Hiring-Decisions.aspx#:~:text=Most%20hiring%20professionals%20say%20they,five%20minutes%20of%20each%20interview.&text=Yet%20there's%20scant%20evidence%20that,and%20gut%20feelings%20are%20effective). But does it lead to hiring people who will perform better in the role? 

This is a question that I’ve been thinking about recently, as I’ve sought to hire the first analyst onto my team. While I’m not an expert, I wanted to outline my thoughts born of recent experience and research.

Undoubtedly, gut decisions or instincts have their place. In [Blink](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink), Malcolm Gladwell argues that people can make very accurate predictions based on very small slices of data. The perennial question, however, is when should we trust our gut and when will it lead us astray? 

# Structured vs unstructured interviews

In an interview setting, I’ve come to believe that a structured, rational approach is more likely to lead to better hiring outcomes. That is, if hiring outcomes are measured by job performance.  [Google’s internal research] (https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/hiring-use-structured-interviewing/steps/read-googles-internal-research/) found that structured interviews, defined as “using the same interviewing methods to assess candidates applying for the same job”, were more predictive of future performance than unstructured interviews. 

Structured interviews are the opposite of interviews in which one presumes to make a decision based on gut feel. It is a way to overlay a systematic framework over the emotive aspects of the interview process. Why would you want to do this? Because humans aren’t as good as we think we are in making hiring decisions.

In an interview with the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html), then senior vice president of people operations at Google, said of the ability of interviewers to predict job performance: “We found zero relationship. It’s a complete random mess.” Despite this, [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11916211) has shown that people think that they are good at making hiring decisions.

# The anatomy of a gut decision

Gut feelings aren’t magic. They are the result of our brains’ behind the scenes processing of complex data, that our conscious minds can’t handle. We consciously perceive the result as a “feeling”. Thus “good” gut decisions are based on very rational premises, even if we can’t articulate what they are. 

In this sense, then, it can pay to trust our gut if we have enough “data” (i.e. experience) to trust our subconscious to make such decisions. For example, [angel investors and surgeons](https://hbr.org/2019/10/when-its-ok-to-trust-your-gut-on-a-big-decision) can make very good gut decisions in the face of complex data. But this is only the case when using that feeling as another data point as opposed to the deciding factor. In addition, those who make successful gut decisions tend to deliberately hone their instincts over time and experience.

So if you’ve spent many hours interviewing for a very specific role, and you can get enough information from the interviews to form a well-founded opinion, then your gut may serve as a reliable guide. The Google research I mentioned above had a caveat - they found “one guy who was highly [able to predict who would be a good hire] because he only interviewed people for a very specialized area, where he happened to be the world’s leading expert.”

# Why we should beware our gut in an interview setting

So, given that humans generally have had years of experience assessing human character in daily life, and that interviewers have had many hours of experience in formal interview settings, why are we so poor at making hiring decisions? Here are some reasons that make sense to me:

**We hold unconscious biases and are [hopelessly unaware of them](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/meet-psychologist-exploring-unconscious-bias-and-its-tragic-consequences-society)**. These lead to [forming impulsive, unfounded impressions of people](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230531326_Candidate_characteristics_driving_initial_impressions_during_rapport_building_Implications_for_employment_interview_validity). Putting this together, we tell ourselves that biases aren’t affecting our hiring decisions, but they are. So we don’t hire people who are best for the job but who we think will be better for the job based on our preconceived notions, many of which we are not privy to.

**We lack data**. An hour-long interview is unlikely to give us enough data points for our subconscious mind to make an informed decision. And even if there are several interviews, adding up gut feelings from several interviewers doesn’t count. Several independent bad decisions won’t magically lead to one good decision when put together.

**Candidates act differently in different situations**. Even with a large amount of time spent interviewing a candidate, we only experience one facet of a person’s identity. In [Your Symphony of Selves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51942229-your-symphony-of-selves), the authors argue that we all have in us many different selves and these are [constantly evolving](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2667055?seq=1). This deserves a post on its own but the upshot of this is that we are catching a person the way they are in interview settings, a narrow cross-section of the person as a whole. Add in the nerves that accompany an interview and you may be getting a very warped picture.

# A good interview shouldn’t have to just feel like a good conversation

I remember many years ago interviewing someone in a completely unstructured way. The candidate looked incredible on paper. But they were like a robot in the interview, probably because he was nervous. It wasn’t a good conversation.

Luckily, the hiring manager decided to give them another chance. They were like a different person the second time I met them. And they ended up being a top performer and fantastic asset to the team. If we’d been more structured in our approach the first time round, we’d have had a better chance of picking up the positive qualities that we only later discovered when getting to know him on the job.

Unfairly dismissing someone because of one bad interview may be less likely with multiple rounds but it probably will remain an issue because being perceived negatively in one interview usually means you don’t get to a subsequent round. And one bad interview can be enough for an interviewer to strongly oppose the hire, which will cancel out any good interview that the candidate had before or since.

# Structure as an antidote to self-doubt

Besides all the above, there is another important reason I’ve personally found to have good structure in interviews: to quel self-doubt or internal conflict. I often have trouble making decisions, constantly second-guessing myself. With an objective criteria on which to score someone, I am better able to confidently assess whether to hire someone, rather than be swayed by internal conflict.

By way of example, say that a candidate doesn’t have the skill-set that you would ideally like a candidate to have right now and be concerned that it will affect their ability to do their job. Now, if you are systematic, taking into account years of work experience, evidence of their ability and willingness to learn, and the other positive qualities that they would bring to the team, it can help focus you around the important aspects of the decision, as opposed to getting swayed by this one factor, which has become salient, but should not be a deal-breaker.

# What to do instead

As Julie Zhou says in [The Making of a Manager](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38821039-the-making-of-a-manager), the best predictor of future performance is past performance in a similar role and situation. Where possible, find examples of their work, ask them questions about previous work, or use case studies that apply to the role for which you are interviewing. I’m far from an expert in this but I hope to publish a follow-up with solutions when I’ve had more experience. For now, I’ll point you to [Rework’s hiring section](https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/hiring/), which offers free evidence-based hiring recommendations.

There will always be a human element to hiring. But if we’re aware of what our guts are telling us, we can incorporate them as one of many data points, to make fairer and better hiring decisions.
